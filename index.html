        Hi my name is Isabel. Since I was a little girl I was obsessed with sports. Basketball was always my favorite sport. Nothing made me more happy than going outside and playing hoops. I would watch basketball movies all the time. Since then I've lost some of the moves I've learned throughout the years, but I still love basketball and all sports really. My top three favorite sports  were soccer, volleyball, and basketball. Whenever I'd play volleyball my grandmother would make fun at how much I threw myself for the ball. In all honesty, that was my favorite part of volleyball. Going in for a save and being able to continue a play when it seemed it was impossible to save always gave me a rush. I saved a play only once, but it was one of the best feelings I'd ever experienced.

        Speaking on another subject, I love dogs. I especially love my two dogs Oliver and Mia. They can be a a handful sometimes but they are way more hilarious than difficult to deal with.
